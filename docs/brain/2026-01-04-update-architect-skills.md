# Brain: Update Severin Architect Skills
Status: ship-it

Updating the `Severin Architect` skill to include missing insights from the engine analysis, specifically regarding `sv_gen`, service probes, and actionable fixes.
- **Topic**: Architecture Documentation
- **Insights to add**:
    - Immutable Rules Policy (use `sv_gen`, don't edit `.cursorrules`).
    - Actionable Fixes (check Ruby files for `fix` blocks).
    - Service Probes (check `sv status` for real readiness).

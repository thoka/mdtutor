# Conversational Summary - 2026-01-06

## 👤 User Intent (Requirement & Context)
The user interrupted an ongoing implementation due to repeated rule violations (specifically, the unauthorized use of `puts` debugging in Ruby code). The primary goal was to find a robust way to prevent these violations by making rules more visible and less dependent on complex, granular state configurations.

## 🛠 Implementation Details
- **Simplified `severin_state.rb`**: Removed granular skill activations and moved to a broader, more stable set of active skills (`:ruby`, `:traceability`, `:dev`, etc.).
- **Enforced "Beta-Rigidity"**: Modified `severin/engine/lib/severin/generator.rb` to ensure that `.cursorrules` are always generated in `rigid: true` mode, preventing the filtering of rules based on the current workflow state or specific tags.
- **Enhanced Ruby Rules**: Added an explicit `🔹NO-PUTS` rule in `severin/rules/1-skills/ruby.rb` to strictly forbid print debugging.
- **Tag Integrity**: Updated `traceability.rb` and `frontend.rb` with their missing respective tags to ensure the validation suite passes.
- **Regeneration**: Ran `sv gen` to apply these infrastructure changes to the actual `.cursorrules` file.

## 🧠 Architectural Decisions (The "Why")
- **Visibility over Granularity**: Decided that during the unstable beta phase, it is better to have all rules visible and enforced rather than hiding them behind context-aware filters that might fail.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Rules are now guaranteed to be injected into the AI context as long as they are defined in the project, reducing "agent amnesia."

## 🚩 Technical Debt & Next Steps
- **State Cleanup**: The `severin_state.rb` still contains some legacy-style comments that could be cleaned up.
- **Next Step**: Start a fresh chat session to verify that the new `.cursorrules` (including the `puts` ban) are correctly picked up and followed by the agent.

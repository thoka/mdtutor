# Chat Summary: Workflow & Glossary Implementation (2026-01-04)

## Discussion Context
The user requested a workflow change to improve traceability and semantic clarity within the MDTutor project and the Severin framework.

## Agreed Requirements (Go)
1. **Chat Documentation**: Summarize requirements in `docs/chat/{timestamp}_summary.md` after a "Go" and append results after implementation.
2. **Scope Check**: Agents must verify if a task fits the current branch/task before implementing; otherwise, create a new feature branch.
3. **Semantic Integrity**: 
    - Define `:tag` as Ruby symbols used for metadata in Severin rules.
    - Define `RID` (Random IDs) as system-generated 5-digit identifiers (🔹xxxxx) that agents must never invent.
4. **Language**: Documentation in `docs/chat/` must be in English.

## Actions Taken
- Created `severin/rules/1-process/chat_docs.rb` to implement the documentation and branch management rules (🔹CHAT-DOC).
- Updated `severin/rules/1-skills/task_manager.rb` with the scope check rule and updated terminology (Requirement-ID -> RID).
- Created `severin/rules/1-skills/glossary.rb` (🔹GLOSSARY) to provide a single source of truth for `:tag` and `RID`.
- Applied metadata tags (`:workflow`, `:chat`, `:branching`) to rules to enable context-aware guidance.
- Regenerated `.cursorrules` and `PROJECT_RULES.md` using `sv gen`.
- Committed all changes to the repository.

## Results
The project now has a formalized process for documenting decisions and a semantic foundation that prevents agents from guessing project-specific terms. The AI's system prompt now includes the glossary and documentation requirements.

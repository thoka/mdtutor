# Conversational Summary: Workflow Refactoring & Safety Net 🔹RHUVZ

## 👤 User Intent (Requirement & Context)
The user wanted to radically simplify the development workflow by unifying commits for the main project and the Severin engine. The goal was to remove bureaucratic hurdles like mandatory feature branches for every small task and separate engine commits. However, after a technical incident during implementation, the intent evolved to include a "Sprint Branch" strategy as a safety net against AI-induced git history corruption.

## 🛠 Implementation Details
- **Unified Commit Action**: Refactored `sv commit` to automatically clean up temporary files (`tmp_*`), reference the latest chat summary, and perform synchronized commits in both the project root and the `severin/engine` submodule.
- **Engine Core Upgrades**: Added essential UI helpers (`ui_info`, `ui_success`, etc.), shell execution proxy (`sh`), and configuration access (`current_options`) to the Severin engine library to support the new action logic.
- **Rules Cleanup**: Removed obsolete rules enforcing atomic submodule commits (`🔹SUB-ATOM`) and strict feature branch naming (`🔹brtTX`).
- **Workspace Maintenance**: Archived over 15 old brain documents from `docs/brain/` to `docs/done/` to reduce cognitive load and noise for the new simplified workflow.
- **Ship Action Update**: Adjusted `sv ship` to support merging from an active sprint/development branch into `main`.

## 🧠 Architectural Decisions (The "Why")
- **Synchronicity**: Treating the engine and project as a single logical unit during commits ensures that rule changes and engine features are always in sync.
- **Automated Context**: Linking commits to chat summaries (`docs/chat/`) provides an automated audit trail of the reasoning behind changes.
- **Sprint-Branch Safety**: While simplifying, a langlebiger development or sprint branch was chosen over direct `main` development to provide an "undo" buffer against potential automation errors.

## 🚩 Technical Debt & Next Steps
- **Branch-Specific Logic**: The `sv commit` action needs explicit warnings/guards when called on `main` or `dev` to enforce the new safety strategy.
- **Direnv Validation**: The environment check `🔹DIRENV-INIT` is currently bypassed and needs to be properly integrated with the local dev environment.
- **Sprint Branch Automation**: The workflow for starting and ending a sprint branch needs to be codified in the rules.

# Walkthrough - Refine Project Header 🔹aNRxT

Refined the project header to be more compact and integrated the hero image seamlessly.

## Changes
- **Header Layout**: Reduced vertical padding and ensured the header can stretch to accommodate a full-height image.
- **Hero Image Integration**:
  - Image now fills the right side of the banner completely (seamless transition).
  - Left corners are sharp (0 rounding).
  - Right corners match the banner's rounding.
  - Reduced width to 12rem (approx 192px) for a more balanced look.
- **Responsiveness**: Added a media query to ensure the header looks good on mobile (switching to vertical layout).

## Verification Results
- Manual check shows a much cleaner and space-efficient header.

# MDTutor Project Rules (Cursor)

You are an expert AI programming assistant. Your primary source of truth for project-specific rules, architecture, and workflows is [PROJECT_RULES.md](PROJECT_RULES.md).

## Core Instructions
- **Always** read [PROJECT_RULES.md](PROJECT_RULES.md) at the start of a session.
- Follow the **Test-First (TDD)** approach strictly.
- Use **Svelte 5 Runes** exclusively for frontend work.
- Keep responses concise and follow the **Minimalism** principle.
- Adhere to the **Git Rules**:
    - **NEVER** code without a **feature branch** (`feature/name`).
    - **ALWAYS** commit an Implementation Plan to `docs/brain/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` **BEFORE** using any tools that modify the system state (edits, runs). The `create_plan` tool is for interactive planning, but the result MUST be committed to the codebase.
    - Use conventional commits.

Refer to [PROJECT_RULES.md](PROJECT_RULES.md) for detailed technical specifications and module-specific guidance.

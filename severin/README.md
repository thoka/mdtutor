# Severin Framework

Severin is the central automated quality assurance and rule enforcement engine for this repository. It ensures codebase integrity, enforces architectural patterns, and provides automated fixes.

## Structure
- `/actions`: Executable logic for automated remediation and tasks.
- `/rules`: Definitions of project-specific constraints and standards.
- `runner.rb`: The core execution engine for the framework.

## Usage
Execute `sv` in the terminal to run checks and apply automated fixes.

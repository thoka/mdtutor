        "plainText": "You will make You are going to create an ‘electronic book’ in Scratch based on your own original idea. Your book will need to meet the project brief. A project brief describes what a project must do. It’s a bit like being given a mission to complete. You will: Think of original design ideas to create an interactive electronic book Choose which skills to use to make your idea Fabricate a physical book with conductive pages and a device for interaction Connect it to your Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins Code the interactive story (you can use your book from the Scratch  pathway, if you have completed it!) Show your friends and family! What you will need To make an electronic book, you will need: A Raspberry Pi computer Socket-to-socket jumper wires Thin cardboard (manila folders or cereal boxes are perfect!) Aluminium foil Glue Strong tape Scissors or a craft knife (get an adult’s permission to use sharp tools!) PROJECT BRIEF: Electronic book You need to create an electronic book. Your book could be a story, a tutorial, a fact book, an interactive book … or something else! Your book should: Have multiple pages with a way to turn to the next page Have at least one sprite Have interactive features on each page Say or do something different with every page Have speech or sound effects Your book could: Have changing backdrops for each page Have text or art created in the Paint editor Have multiple ‘buttons’ on each page An electronic book is made up of multiple pages with conductive inserts, which interact with code written in Scratch. Get ideas 💭 Think about the topic of your book as you watch this example project video showing a ‘Interactive Fantasy Book’ to get more ideas: Interactive Fantasy Book: Your idea Use this step to plan your book. You can plan by just thinking, by adding backdrops and sprites in Scratch, drawing or writing, or however you like! Why are you making the book? Think about the purpose of your book. It could be: To entertain a younger child To share an important message such as encouraging recycling To teach someone how to do something such as make your favourite food To tell or retell a story To share something about yourself To express yourself and be creative Who is it for? Think about who you will make your book for (your audience). It could be for a friend, a family member, a school class, people who share a hobby, fans of a musician, or just for yourself. Now it’s time to start thinking about the pages (backdrops) and the characters and objects (sprites) in your book. Open a new Scratch project on your Raspberry Pi. Use your new Scratch project, a pen and paper, or both to plan ideas for your book. Think about the backdrops and sprites: Which backdrops or background colours will you use in your book? How will users interact with your book to turn to the next page? Which characters and objects will you have in your book? How will the sprites be animated and interact on each page? Save your project Make your pages Once you have some ideas for the story and ways to interact with your book, you can start to make the pages. Decide how many pages you will need for your electronic book. You could have one per backdrop, or just a cover and a single inside page with multiple buttons. Decide what your interaction tool will look like. This is the thing your reader will touch to the pages to activate the book. It might be a magic wand, a star, or anything you like! Each page needs to have a back and a front made of cardboard (or other non-conductive material), with internal contacts made from aluminium foil. Gather or cut the needed amount of cardboard for your book’s pages. If you are using cardboard, you need to cut out a back and a front piece for each page. If you are using manila folders, envelopes, or similar items, you can use one per page. The front side of each page needs to have a simple design that relates to what is happening in your book. You will cut these designs out of each page and replace them with foil. The foil will be connected to the Raspberry Pi’s general purpose (GP) pins to create buttons for your reader to interact with. Draw the designs you want on each page. Keep them fairly simple, as more complex shapes may not work well. You can search online for ‘stencil’ images to see some good examples. Once you have drawn all the designs you need on the front side of each page, cut them out using a craft knife or scissors. Make sure you get permission from an adult to use sharp tools. Take your socket-socket jumper wires and remove one of the ends by pulling it off using a little force. You do this to expose the internal core of the wire. Turn your cut-out image over so you are looking at the back (or the inside of your manila folder). Now coat the edges of the cut-out picture with glue, and press the exposed end of the wire to the sticky surface, with the F end hanging out toward where the spine of your book will be. I'm making more than one button per page! If you are making multiple buttons on each page, you must make sure that your foil pieces are not touching, otherwise you will get a short circuit. You also need to add a new wire for each button. Keep them as close together as you can, as this will make it easier to connect them to the Raspberry Pi later. Tear off a sheet of foil and place it over the cut-out, pressing it down firmly on the sticky surface to make sure it is stuck all over. Tape down the free end of the wire as close to the spine as you can to keep it from pulling loose. Coat the piece of cardboard that will be the back of the page with glue. Press it down firmly onto the front piece to finish the page. The foil and wire should be sandwiched between the two pieces of cardboard. If you like, you can also tape the edges of your page closed for extra durability. Repeat these steps for each of your pages, then bind them together along the spine using strong tape to make a book. Once you have your book completed, you need to create your interaction tool; this tool will allow the reader to press the buttons because it acts as a common ground contact that can close the circuit for each of the cut-out pictures. In this example, I am making a magic wand as an interaction tool. For your tool, you can cut any shape you like from cardboard to wrap in foil, or simply have a look in the recycling bin for something suitable to wrap in foil. Cut your desired shape for your interaction tool from cardboard (or reuse a discarded item from the recycling bin). In the example, I am just going to wrap a pencil in foil to create my magic wand. Pull the end off a socket-socket wire and glue or tape it down firmly to the base of the interaction tool, with the free end hanging toward where the user will grip the tool. Then wrap the tool in aluminium foil and secure the base with more glue or tape. Connect your pages and interaction tool to your Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins, taking note of which pins you connect to. You could also use some pin-socket jumper cables to extend your wires if you want to make it easier to use the book. In the example, the pages are connected to Pins , , , , and , while the magic wand interaction tool is connected to GND (ground) pin . Once you have your book and interaction tool wired up, it’s time to write the code! Code and test Now it’s time to make the digital part of your book. Start small, and add more to your project if you have time. Tip: Remember to test your project each time you add something. It’s much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes. First, open a new project in Scratch on your Raspberry Pi and add the Simple Electronics extension to your project. You will need to decide what order to build your book. To get started, you could: Create all the pages as backdrops, or Get one page working first You may not have time to add everything you want to your book. That’s okay, you can always come back to it later. If you have completed the Scratch  pathway, you will have collected some very useful skills. If you haven’t yet completed that pathway, you should do it next! Here’s a reminder to help you make your electronic book: Code: Use backdrops to create pages or levels You can use backdrops in a Scratch project to create different pages or levels. Changing backdrop tutorial: See inside Click on the Stage pane and then the Backdrops tab to view the backdrops for your project. You can drag the backdrops to reorder them. There are lots of ways to move to the next backdrop. Choose one that works for your project. when [space v] key pressed next backdrop when stage clicked // click on the Stage next backdrop when this sprite clicked // click on a sprite next backdrop when backdrop switches to [page1 v] wait [] seconds next backdrop Show the mood of a sprite with costumes Abby thinks “Hmm”: See inside You can use switch costume to blocks before and after a say for, think for, play sound, or wait block to make your character show their feelings. switch costume to [abby-a v] // starting costume wait [] seconds switch costume to [abby-b v] // show feelings think [Hmm...] for [] seconds switch costume to [abby-a v] // back to starting costume Tip: Make sure that you use a block that has a time value, not a start sound, say, or think block, otherwise, you will not see the costume change. Animate sprite movement with costumes Hedgehog walking: See inside You can use switch costume to and move blocks in a repeat loop to animate a moving character. Change the time in the wait block to change the speed. when flag clicked // switch between two costumes repeat [] switch costume to [hedgehog-a v] move [] steps wait [.] seconds switch costume to [hedgehog-b v] move [] steps wait [.] seconds end Tip: If you want to use all the costumes that a sprite has, you can just use the next costume block in a loop. Tip: Increase the number of steps in each move block to make the sprite go faster. Change the number in the repeat loop to adjust the distance. Tip: To make the sprite move backwards, you can use negative numbers, for example, move - steps. Or, you can use a point in direction - block to change the sprite’s direction before the sprite moves (- points to the left). Use graphic effects Rooster effects: See inside The set color effect to and change color effect by blocks both have drop-down menus in which you can choose from a range of different graphic effects that can be used to change your sprite’s appearance: color: from  to  (bigger numbers will wrap around, so  is the same as ) fisheye:  means no effect, bigger numbers cause a bigger ‘fisheye’ effect, and negative numbers cause a reverse ‘fisheye’ effect whirl:  means no effect, big numbers make a big whirl to the left, and big negative numbers make a big whirl to the right pixelate:  means no effect, and bigger numbers create more pixels mosaic:  means no effect, and bigger or negative numbers affect the number of copies brightness:  means no effect, numbers up to  make the sprite lighter, and negative numbers down to - make the sprite darker ghost:  means no effect, and numbers up to  make the sprite more transparent Try to set the different effect values to see what each one does. Explore how different effect changes make your sprite look. set [whirl v] effect to () set [pixelate v] effect to () Tip: A color effect of  is the same as a color effect of , so you can keep changing the colour. For other graphic effects, no other changes will be made after you reach the maximum or minimum number for the effect. forever change [color v] effect by [] wait [.] seconds Use the clear graphic effects block to start again. Clicking on the green flag also clears all graphic effects. To set a graphic effect for a sprite when the project is started, place a set graphic effect to block under a when green flag clicked block: when green flag clicked set [ghost v] effect to () Tip: You can also set and change graphic effects for the Stage. Show and hide sprites on different backdrops When you are creating a book, animation, presentation, or game with levels, some sprites should only show on some backdrops. Show and hide sprites on different backdrops: See inside Click on the Stage or press the Space key to switch to the next backdrop. Use show and hide blocks with the when backdrop switches to block to make sprites only show on the backdrops where they belong. The Beachball sprite: when backdrop switches to [Beach Rio v] show when backdrop switches to [Soccer  v] hide Set the backdrop when green flag clicked to make sure that sprites show or hide correctly on the first backdrop: when flag clicked switch backdrop to [Beach Rio v] Tip: You can also make sprites show and hide when green flag clicked. Position sprites with layers There are two ways to position your sprites into layers. You can drag a sprite on the Stage to move it to the front layer: Alternatively, you can use a go to front layer or go to back layer block to position a sprite. If you want a sprite to always stay at the front or back, use a forever loop to make the sprite move back to the correct layer if you accidentally move it: when flag clicked forever go to [front v] layer // or back Jiggle a sprite repeat [] turn left [] degrees wait [.] seconds turn right [] degrees wait [.] seconds turn right [] degrees wait [.] seconds turn left [] degrees wait [.] seconds end Paint editor – backdrops and costumes: Create a new backdrop in the Paint editor Go to the Choose a Backdrop menu and click on Paint: You will be taken to the Paint editor, where the new backdrop will be highlighted in the list. If you have other backdrops in your project, you will also see them in the list. To set the main colour of the backdrop, click on the Rectangle tool, then use the Fill colour chooser to select a colour, then drag the shape over the full backdrop canvas: If you want to add more details to your backdrop, you can use the Rectangle tool, Circle tool, or Brush tool, or a combination of all three! When you have finished, make sure that you give your new backdrop a name that makes sense: Your new backdrop will be shown on the Stage and will be available to use in Looks blocks. Create backdrops and sprites using shapes You can create backdrops and costumes for sprites in the Paint editor, using just shapes. Go to the Choose a Sprite or Choose a Backdrop menu and choose the Paint option: Select which tool(s) to use to make the shape(s) that you want: Circle: Click on the Circle tool to draw a circle. Press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard to draw a perfect circle. Rectangle: Click on the Rectangle tool to draw a rectangle. Press and hold the Shift key to draw a square. Triangle: Use the Rectangle tool to draw a rectangle or a square. Click on the Reshape tool and select the corner that you want to remove. Click on the Delete tool to turn your shape into a triangle. You can use the Fill tool to change the colour of a shape: You may need to use the Forward and Backward tools to move your shapes forward or backward so that they are positioned correctly within your image: You can select all the shapes and Group them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape: Here is an example of a sprite created with the Circle and Rectangle tools: Pig: See inside Remember to name the costumes and backdrops that you create in the Paint editor. Use the Text tool Click on the Fill colour chooser and select the colour that you want for your text: Select the Text tool: Click on the Paint editor and start typing. Click on the Font drop-down menu and select the font that you want: If you want to resize your text, click on the Select (Arrow) tool and select the text, then drag the corner handles to resize the text: If you want to change the Fill colour of your text, use the Fill colour chooser to select a colour, then select the Fill (Bucket) tool and hold your mouse cursor over the text (or if you are using a tablet, tap the text). The text will automatically change colour. Click on the text to make the change: If you want each word in a message to be a different colour, size, and font, follow the process above for each word in your message. Position your text and/or group of words with the crosshair in the centre of the Paint editor: To layer your words, use the Forward and Backward tools: Copy parts between sprite costumes Click on the Costumes tab for your sprite. Tip: Duplicate the costume that you want to edit — so that you can still use the original costume if you need to. To do this, right-click (or on a tablet, tap and hold) on the costume and choose duplicate. You will now have a copy of the costume: To remove any part of the costume that you do not need any more, click on the part to select it, then click on Delete: The duplicated costume with parts removed should look something like this: Tip: If you make a mistake in the Paint editor, you can click on Undo: Go to the costume with the part that you want to add and click on the part that you need, then click on Copy: If you want to add a part from a costume that is not already shown in the Costumes tab, you need to add the costume to your sprite first. Click on the Choose a Costume icon, then find the costume that you want and click on it to add it to your sprite: When you have copied the part that you need, go back to the duplicated costume and click on Paste. The duplicated costume should now look something like this: Now, switch to the Code tab. You will be able to use the new costume in your code blocks: switch costume to [nano-a2 v] // the edited costume Add a costume to a sprite Click on the Costumes tab and then on Choose a Costume to add any costume to the sprite from the Costume Library: You will need to position and resize the added costume in the Paint editor, to match the sprite’s other costumes. Tip: If you position a sprite on the Stage and then change its costume, the sprite might appear to ‘jump’ or change size. You will need to position and resize the costumes in the Paint editor so that they all appear in the right position on the Stage. Sound: Add a sound to a sprite or the Stage Select the sprite that you want to have the new sound, then select the Sounds tab. Each sprite starts with a default sound: Scratch has a library of sounds that you can add to your sprites. Click on the Choose a Sound icon to open the Sound Library: To play a sound, hold your mouse cursor (or your finger, if you are using a tablet) over the Play icon: Click on any sound to add it to your sprite. You will be taken straight back to the Sounds tab and you will be able to see the sound that you have just added: If you switch to the Code tab and look at the Sound blocks menu, you will be able to select the new sound: Tip: You can also add sounds to the Stage. Record a sound Select the sprite that you want to have the new recorded sound, then select the Sounds tab: Go to the Choose a Sound menu and select the Record option: When you are ready, click the Record button to start recording your sound: Click the Stop recording button to stop recording your sound: Your new recording will be shown. You can Re-record your sound if you are not happy with it. Drag the orange circles to crop your sound; the part of the sound with a blue background (between the orange circles) will be the part that is kept: When you are happy with your recording, click the Save button. You will be taken straight back to the Sounds tab and you will be able to see the sound that you have just added: If you switch to the Code tab and look at the Sound blocks menu, you will be able to select the new sound: Make a sprite talk with the Text to Speech extension Pico and Giga talk with the speech extension: See inside Click on Add Extension: Choose Text to Speech: You will get a new Text to Speech blocks menu: You can use the blocks in the Text to Speech blocks menu to make your sprites talk out loud. You can make a sprite talk out loud when clicked: when this sprite clicked set voice to (alto v) :: tts set language to (Spanish v) :: tts speak [Hola] :: tts You can even give your sprite a kitten voice! set voice to (kitten v) :: tts speak [Cat gotta haz milk.] :: tts Editor: Copy code from one sprite to another You can copy code from one sprite to another sprite in the Sprite list: Both sprites will have the code blocks that you have copied. If you are moving the code from one sprite to the other, you can delete the code from the first sprite after you have copied it to the other sprite. Run a Scratch project in full-screen mode To run your project in full-screen mode in Scratch, go to the area above the Stage and click on the icon with four arrows that point outwards. This is the Full Screen Control icon: To exit full-screen mode, click on the Full Screen Control icon again. It will have four arrows that point inwards. Duplicate a sprite Right-click (or on a tablet, tap and hold) on your first sprite in the Sprite list below the Stage: Select duplicate. This will create a copy of your first sprite, with the suffix “”: Rename your sprite: Your sprite’s name will change in the Sprite list: Your second sprite has exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have started to change the second sprite’s code — you might not see the second sprite because it might be positioned underneath the first sprite. Test: Show someone else your project and get their feedback. Do you want make any changes to your book? Debug: You might find some bugs in your code that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs: My sprite is showing or hiding on the wrong pages Check that the sprite has when backdrop switches to scripts with show or hide as needed. Check that you have chosen the correct backdrop name in the when backdrop switches to scripts. It helps to give backdrops good names to help spot problems like this. My sprite is going upside down Add a set rotation style left-right or set rotation style don't rotate block. My sprite 'jumps' when it changes costume or bounces Make sure that the costume is centred in the Paint editor (line up the blue cross with the cross hairs in the centre of the Paint editor). My sound does not play Have you added a block to play sound when the sprite is clicked? If you have copied code from another sprite, you will need to add the sound to this sprite from the Sounds tab. Check the volume on your computer and make sure that you have not lowered the volume with code — try set volume to . More than one thing is happening at a time You may have a short circuit between two contacts. Somewhere in the faulty page, your foil or wires are touching and activating at the same time. Alternatively, you may not have selected the right number for your pins in the code. Go back and check that all your When button [ ] pressed blocks have the right values for the pins you are connected to. Nothing happens when I touch the tool to a contact You may not have a good connection to the foil inside the page or your tool. Check the connection from the wire to the foil is clear in both cases — sometimes too much glue can insulate your wire! Alternatively, you may not have selected the right number for your pins in the code. Go back and check that all your When button [ ] pressed blocks have the right values for the pins you are connected to. Once you have created the code and interactions for your book and know it is working the way you want, you can upgrade your project and share it with friends and family! Save your project",
